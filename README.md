# book-your-resort
We have implemented software that simulates the management of a booking in a luxury resort. To do this we took advantage of advanced programming methods of the **JAVA language** such as the Design Patterns and some advanced JAVA techniques, together with some modules that we have integrated such as sending the email and generating the customer's invoice after booking.

You can find the source code inside the bookyourresort.zip file.
You can run the software by using the jar file with this command:

```
java -jar BookYourResort.jar
```

List of the **Design Patterns** we implemented:
- Composite
- Observer
- Strategy
- Decorator
- Flyweight
- Factory
